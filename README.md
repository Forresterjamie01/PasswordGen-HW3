## Password Generator Assignment
## In this assignment, I updated the Javascript, CSS and HTML
This device generates a random password on user-selected inputs.
This Java Script developed passwored generator was created in VS Code.

Within this file, I included the css, screenshot, images, html and js file.

I am still struggling to get the device to work...even with all my code implemented, so in conclusion, I am better at working in with html and css. Javascript is a little challenging.

I tried for the longest, but couldnt get this error fixed. I think everything else is right.
